# National Park Service Arctic Inventory and Monitoring Network Park Observer Observation Protocol (obsprot) repository.
The NPS Yellow-billed loons monitoring program relies on NPS Park Observer software for field data collection. The software relies on an observation protocol (.obsprot) file to define what data is collected. This repository contains the most current .obsprot file used for loon surveys.

Information on .obsprot files and their specifications can be found on the Alaska Regional GIS team web site at http://akrgis.nps.gov/observer/new_survey.html
